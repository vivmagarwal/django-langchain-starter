File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repopack's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

Here's an updated `README.md` file with Python version 3.10.15:

# Django + Langchain Project Setup

This project sets up a Python environment using `Poetry` for automatic dependency management. We will install `Django` and various `Langchain` packages in an isolated virtual environment with Python 3.10.15.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10.15 (managed with `pyenv`)
- Poetry (installed with `pipx`)

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Install `pyenv` to Manage Python Versions

Follow these steps to install `pyenv`:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Configure your shell (add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

Restart your terminal and verify:

```bash
pyenv --version
```

### 2. Install Python 3.10.15

Install the required Python version:

```bash
pyenv install 3.10.15
pyenv local 3.10.15
```

### 3. Install `pipx` to Manage CLI Tools

Install `pipx`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pipx --version
```

### 4. Install `Poetry`

Install `Poetry` using `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

Verify installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### 5. Set Up the Python Project

Create a new project or navigate to an existing one:

```bash
# For a new project:
poetry new my_project
cd my_project

# For an existing project:
cd existing_project
poetry init
```

### 6. Add Django and Langchain Dependencies

Install `Django` and all the `Langchain` dependencies in your project using `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry add django langchain langchain-chroma langchain-community langchain-core \
langchain-experimental langchain-huggingface langchain-openai langchain-text-splitters
```

### 7. Verify Installed Packages

After installation, you can verify all installed dependencies:

```bash
poetry show
```

### 8. Use the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment created by `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### 9. Running Django Commands

To start a Django project:

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
```

## Conclusion

You are now ready to start developing with `Django` and the various `Langchain` libraries in an isolated, Poetry-managed environment using Python 3.10.15. If you encounter any issues, feel free to check the official documentation for `Poetry` and `Langchain`.
```

This updated `README.md` reflects the use of Python 3.10.15 for the project. Let me know if you need any further changes!
